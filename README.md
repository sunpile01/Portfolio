# Portfolio
This repository contains the most interesting projects I have worked on during my bachelors degree at NTNU. Every project have been added as a submodule. When cloning this repository the submodules will be empty. The easiest way to navigate to each project is to just click on the submodule folders at this Github page and it will redirect you to the repository of that project. However, if you want to clone this main repository and then populate the submodule folders, you have to use ```"git submodule init <repositopry name>"``` followed by ```"git submodule update <repository name>"```. I do not recommend to update and initialize all submodules recursively in one command, as some of the repositories are rather large. 

For the group projects "Fullstack-MealPlanner", "Bachelor-File-Converter" and "Unity-TowerDefense-Game" the SCRUM development method was followed.

I strongly recommend to take a look at this [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi9mMhBK8H4dB0s10bniXvw) I have created for the projects you are interested in. In this playlist I have one video for every project where I showcase the functionality and explain what I have done.
